## Description

For this challenge I developed a portfolio using HTML and CSS. 

## Solutions/Notes

- I started with a header including links to a about me section, my work, and how to contact me.
- I then made sure that each link was anchored to the right section on the page when clicked upon.
- I included a photo of myself before the about me.
- I created an about me section and included a brief paragraph/overview of myself.
- I then made a made a section for my work including placeholder links that will go to the projects when we create them. I made sure to have the first photo larger than the others.
- I included a contact me section with different ways to contact me.
- I also made sure that the page was responsive and scaled accordingly.
